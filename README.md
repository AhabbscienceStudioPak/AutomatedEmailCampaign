During my internship at Askari Bank, I contributed to the front end of an email management application. As a subsequent side project, I extended it into a fully automated email campaign management system.
The Automated Email Campaign Management System is a comprehensive solution designed for automating the entire lifecycle of email campaigns. This system streamlines the creation, management, and execution of campaigns, providing users with a seamless and efficient experience.

## Technologies
* Developed with ASP.NET MVC Core for a robust and scalable backend.
* Utilizes PostgreSQL as the database management system for efficient data storage.
* Employs Entity Framework Core for seamless data access and manipulation.
* Utilizes the Mailgun SMTP API for reliable and secure email delivery, ensuring that campaigns reach their intended recipients.
* Incorporates Bootstrap for a responsive and visually appealing user interface, accessible across various devices.

## Dependencies
* .NET Core 7.0
* PostgreSQL
* Entity Framework Core
* Mailgun API
* Bootstrap 5

## How to Set and Use
